### Discord has become more strict about selfbot use and will ban without warning. I don't take any responsibility about what happen to your account

## Requirement

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * Bot Core Runtime
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Optional)
    * For clonning this repository
   
## Installation

* Clone or Download this repository
 
* Install Eris Library through npm
 
```bash
npm install Eris -g
```

* Grab your Token from Discord
    * On Discord, do ```Ctrl + Shift + i``` on Windows or ```Cmd + Option + i``` on Mac in that order.
    * Go into the Network tab, and wait for some requests to show up. If there are none, create one by typing in any channel.
    * Find a request that has an authorization key in the request headers. Screenshot of network tab. Grab the value given for authorization. This is your token.
Don't give this out to anyone! You'll need this token soon.

Note: If you change your password or enable/disable two-factor authentication, your token will change. If this happens, and you've already set up the bot, you'll need to change the token by editing the config.json file under settings.
